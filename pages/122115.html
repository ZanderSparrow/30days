			  	<h3>Once upon a time...</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	A beggar woman and her son were returning home when he saw a blue belt. She forbade him to pick it up, but after a time, he sneaked away from her and got it; it made him feel as strong as a giant. When she had to rest, he climbed a crag and saw light; he came down to his mother to suggest they seek shelter there. When she could go no further, he carried her, but she saw that the house was that of trolls. He insisted, and she fainted. A 20-foot-tall old man was within; the boy called him "grandfather" and he said he had been sitting there three hundred years without anyone calling grandfather. They talked, and the old man prepared supper for them by killing an oxen with one hand.

					At night, the boy got the cradle, and the old man gave his mother the bed. The old man told the mother that if they got rid of her son, they could live happily together; he promised to crush the boy under rocks at the quarry. The boy went with him, the next day, but the boy was unhurt and rolled a stone on the troll that crushed his leg. The troll told the boy's mother that he had a garden with twelve lions in that would tear him to pieces. The mother pretended to be sick and sent him for lion's milk, but there, the boy dashed the biggest to pieces, cowing the others, and got the milk. The troll swore he didn't believe it, but the boy tossed him to the eleven lions, which had come with him, and then rescued him.
